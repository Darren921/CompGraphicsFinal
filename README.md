For outlining I used the shader shown in class with a shader graph with the outline being generated with regards to the camera’s location to the object and by only having the front faces generated.

However I also added the ability to blend a texture onto the outline in order for it to be more visible in the darker scene.This is the end result, shown below, which was blend with a ice texture

For vertex coloring I used the shader shown in class which gets a vertex and applies color to it, it also moves the vertices non destructively  and tweaked it so each color has its own section 
and didn’t interfere with the other sections. There is also a texture blended onto the base color sections to provide a track and direction feel. This is the end result, blended with a water foam texture.

Finally I added a toon shader for Lakitu and the light in order to still have the cartoon feel that is commonly in mario games, in this case I used the toon shader shown in class as a base and added a texture to it in order to create the rocky appearance Lakitu has in the game, this is the end result with a rock texture + toon shader

Please note that all textures are found the resource given in class and are located in the textures folder
