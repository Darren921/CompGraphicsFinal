For outlining I used the shader shown in class with a shader graph with the outline being generated with regards to the camera’s location to the object and by only having the front faces generated.

However I also added the ability to blend a texture onto the outline in order for it to be more visible in the darker scene.This is the end result, shown below, which was blend with a ice texture 



For vertex coloring I used the shader shown in class which gets a vertex and applies color to it, it also moves the vertices non destructively  and tweaked it so each color has its own section

and didn’t interfere with the others, there is also a texture blended onto the base color sections to provide a track and direction feel. This is the end result, blended with a water foam texture.
